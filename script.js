        <br>

        <div class="about-content">
            <p>My life's journey has been a diverse one, starting in Essex, England, and taking me through my formative years in Ireland. It was during this time, particularly at the North Atlantic Basketball Academy in Dublin, that I cultivated valuable lessons in effective communication and unwavering commitment.</p>
            
            <p>Having recently started as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://scale.com/" target="_blank">Scale AI</a>, I am excited to expand my knowledge further in differing fields.</p>
            
            <p>I am also a Student Manager at the <a href="https://www.luther.edu/offices/its/help-desk">Technology Help Desk</a> at Luther College, where I lead a team of technicians to provide technical support and assistance to the college community.</p>
            
            <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Data Science at <a href="https://www.luther.edu/" target="_blank">Luther College</a>, with a specialization in Biology. I am passionate about learning and exploring the intersections and applications of these fields in various domains and contexts.</p>
            
            <p>In August 2023, I completed a Data Analysis and DE&I externship with Credera <a href="https://www.credera.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Credera</a> , achieving an Outstanding Completion status and gaining valuable insights and experience in data-driven decision-making and diversity, equity, and inclusion practices.</p>
